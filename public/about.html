<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>"Hello, my name is Mohammed Faizaan, and I am currently in my 3rd year of B.Tech at St. John's College of Engineering and Technology. I completed my schooling at Akshara Shree High School. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a keen interest in technology and innovation, constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow.</p>

<p>I believe in the power of problem-solving and have worked on enhancing these skills through various projects and competitions. I also highly value teamwork, having collaborated with diverse teams during events like Kreative and #geekstreak2024. These experiences have helped me build strong communication skills and the ability to work efficiently towards common goals.</p>

<p>However, I recognize that one of my weaknesses is trusting everyone easily, which sometimes leads to challenges in decision-making. Additionally, I experience public speaking anxiety, though I am actively working on improving my confidence and presentation skills.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I enjoy taking part in technical competitions and exploring creative pursuits, such as managing an Instagram page for my ginger cat called MeowInOrange."</p>
